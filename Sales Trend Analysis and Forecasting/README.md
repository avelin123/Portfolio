# Sales Trend Analysis and Forecasting

## **Overview**
This project was completed as part of my Master's degree in **Big Data and High-Performance Computing**. The goal was to develop a sales forecasting model using historical sales data to predict future sales trends. The project involved using machine learning techniques, including **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing**, to make accurate sales predictions.

## **Key Objectives**
- Preprocess and clean historical sales data.
- Build machine learning models to predict future sales trends.
- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
- Visualize the forecasted sales against actual sales.

## **Key Techniques and Tools**
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing** for forecasting.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared data by handling missing values, outliers, and creating time-related features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used RMSE and MAPE to assess the accuracy of the models.
- **Visualization**: Generated plots to compare the predicted and actual sales over time.

## **Outcomes**
- An accurate sales forecasting model with a high degree of prediction accuracy.
- Visualized sales trends to aid decision-making in inventory management and resource allocation.

## **Files**
- **Dataset**:
  - `supermarket_sales - Sheet1.csv`: The historical sales data used for forecasting.
- **Code**:
  - `Forecast.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the sales forecasting model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
