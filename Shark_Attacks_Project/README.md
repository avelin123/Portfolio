# Shark Attacks Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Dataquest Business Analyst with Power BI learning path**. It demonstrates my ability to clean and prepare messy datasets for analysis using Microsoft Excel. The Shark Attacks dataset contains global records of shark-related incidents, and I applied various techniques to address data quality issues.

## Key Objectives
- Remove unnecessary columns.
- Remove blank/duplicate entries.
- Handle missing values systematically.
- Standardize text formats.

## Key Techniques and Functions
- **Excel Functions**: Used functions like TRIM, RIGHT, LEFT, IF, OR etc.
- **Data Validation**: Ensured integrity and consistency.

## Outcomes
- A clean, analysis-ready dataset.
- Improved accuracy and reduced inconsistencies.

## Files
- **Dataset**:
  - `shark_attacks_raw_data.csv`: The original dataset before cleaning.
  - `shark_attacks_cleaned_data.csv`: The final dataset after cleaning.
- **Excel File**: `cleaning_steps.xlsx`: Detailed steps of transformations applied.
